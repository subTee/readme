BLUF: This is NOT @subTee (Casey Smith), it’s @redeemedHacker.

Perception on this might look bad, but it was done with good intentions.  @exord66, @dirty_tizzle and I noticed pretty quickly when @subTee’s accounts went dark this week.  We were all deeply saddened by Casey’s break from the www, but it’s much deserved.  He’s given a ton to our community.

I had a concern that someone could claim his deactivated accounts and do evil (ex. post his code back with backdoors).  @exord66 had the idea to claim his accounts before anyone else did and save them for @subTee’s return...should he want them on his return.  After the three of us discussed it for a few minutes, I attempted to claim three of his old accounts (twitter.com/subTee, subt0x10.blogspot.com, and github.com/subtee).  I was only successful at claiming the github account.

This github account will be immediately returned to Casey on his return/at his request, should he want it.  It will ONLY be returned to the real/verified @subTee though.
